## About the Module

REPLAPI is a module that crawls the internet retrieving your(and anyone elses) replit data! 

It is currently very slow, and will most likely cause a lot of lag to a game, your computer, or replit(and anything really). So because of this, it is still in beta, but we are trying to improve the speed and we hope it will be lightning fast(or at least not take 10 seconds) for the end of the project! Now, lets talk about how to actually install this this module.
